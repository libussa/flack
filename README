About flack
-----------

flack was born when I decided I didn't need a GUI to edit my FLAC
collection. Having put quite some time into this project, it seemed
appropriate to share it with the community.

For installation instructions, view the INSTALL file.

Important Notes
---------------

- Depending on how many flack files you have, the temporary directory
  can become a few MB in size. If flack is not running, you can safely
  delete the temporary directory (/tmp/flack-USERNAME).

- flack now runs checks on startup that determine whether any files
  throw up errors when accessed by metaflac. If you are accessing a
  very large directory and the files have already been checked, you
  can skip with the '-s' option but this is generally not recommended.

- Also checked is whether the file can be written to. These are
  excluded unless the '-i' command line option is passed. Useful for
  if you just wish to view tags of files that do not belong to your
  user. However, at the moment this will break flack if you try to edit
  unwritable files!

- The syntax of the flackrc file has changed for the 2.0.0 release, so
  it is important that you use the new file instead. The option to
  change the temporary directory has been removed, as this causes
  problems and there really shouldn't be a need to change it anyway.
  The option to change the logfile is still available though, but when
  running multiple instances of flack, they will all write to the same
  logfile.

- The --keep-special-characters option is used during renaming of
  filenames according to their tags. Normally, any occurrences of '?'
  ':' or a leading '-' are replaced with '_'. With this option,
  these characters are not replaced.

- Now when viewing a single file, it's tags are displayed above the
  menu if there are 10 lines or less. This value can be changed with
  the '-m' command line option.
